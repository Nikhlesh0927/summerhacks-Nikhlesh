    <h1>CHILDHOOD AND FAMILY</h1>
    <p>
      Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[6] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[7][8][9] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.[10] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[9][11] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[12][13] His paternal grandmother had British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[14][15]
      After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[14] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[16] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he has described as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[16] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[12][17]
      At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing while using the Commodore VIC-20.[18] He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[19][20] An awkward and introverted child,[21] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[16][22] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[23]

    <h1>EDUCATION</h1>
    <p>
       Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied
       for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother. While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate his great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at a youth hostel. He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan. He stayed there for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in economics from the Wharton School   and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in physics.
      In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage startup called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Ph.D. program in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California.Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.

    <h1>BUSINESS CAREER</h1>
    <h2>X.COM AND PAYPAL</h2>
    <p>
      In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[48] The startup was one of the first online banks to be federally insured, and, within its initial months, over 200,000 customers joined the service.[49] The company's investors saw Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[50] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to prevent unnecessary competition.[38][50][51] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[52] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.[46][53] Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[54] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[55][note 3] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[57][58] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7%—received over $100 million.[59][60].In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.[61][62]

  <h2>SPACEX</h2>
  <p>
    In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself.[63] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[64] With $100 million of his early fortune,[65] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.[66].After three failed launches, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 in 2008. It was the first private liquid-fuel rocket to reach Earth orbit.[67] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[68] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[69] Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9.[70] Landings were later achieved on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform.[71] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[72][73] In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), which would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities.[74] In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called dearMoon project.[75] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first manned flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place a person into orbit and dock a crewed space-craft with the ISS.[76]SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access,[77] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[78] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[79][note 4]

  <h2>TESLA</h2>
  <p>
    Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[82] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[83] Musk led the Series A round of investment in 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[84][85] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[86] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[87][88] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[89] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[4][5] As of 2019, Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[90]Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[91] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012;[92] a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[93][94] A mass market sedan, the Model 3 was released in 2017.[95][96] As of March 2020, it is the world's best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered.[97] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[98] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[99][100] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China.[101][102][103]Since its initial public offering in 2010,[104] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020.[105][106] It entered the S&P 500 later that year.[107][108]
